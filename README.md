Android-Maps-DB
===============
Problem Statement:
------------------
Consider a non-smartphone user.

How will he know his location? What if he is lost?

Solution:
---------

My Android Application is the Solution.

Explanation:
------------

When an user is lost, he sends an SMS to the Android Phone in which Maps DB is installed using a known Password and a Query of what he wants to know.

Eg: ****** Adyar,Chennai Restaurants

  In which the Query is the list of restaurants in or near the area Adyar.(note: the password can be changed and given to only trusted sources).

The Application on recognizing the correct password will process the Query and return the result via SMS to the sender of the Query.
